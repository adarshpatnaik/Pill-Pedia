            <p>A cough is a reflex action to clear your airways of mucus and irritants such as dust or smoke. It's
                rarely a sign of anything serious.
                Most coughs clear up within 3 weeks and don't require any treatment.
                A dry cough means it's tickly and doesn't produce any phlegm (thick mucus). A chesty cough means phlegm
                is produced to help clear your airways.
                CoughCoughs in children often have similar causes to those mentioned above.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h2>Types of <span>Cough</span> :</h2>
        <p>A cough is considered ‘acute’ if it lasts less than three weeks and ‘chronic’
            if it lasts longer than eight weeks in adults or four weeks in children.
            There are various types of cough and the conditions associated with those coughs can overlap.</p>
        <li>
            <h3><span>Chesty</span> cough :</h3>
            <p>Otherwise known as a wet cough or phlegmy cough, this makes a person’s chest feel heavy and the
                cough brings up mucus or phlegm. Each cough can produce a clump of mucus and therefore these
                types of cough are called ‘productive coughs’. Chesty coughs are caused by viruses from colds
                and flu and they can happen after a sore throat. Chesty coughs are worse in the mornings as you
                tend to cough less while asleep, during which time the mucus produced by the cells in the air
                passages builds up overnight, leading to excessive coughing and mucus expelling when you wake
                up. Other more serious causes of chesty coughs include asthma, heart failure or chronic
                bronchitis.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3><span>Tickly</span> cough :</h3>
            <p>This is the most common type of cough. It is caused by irritation in the throat and they tend to
                be the most annoying type of cough. It is a non-productive cough as it produces little or no
                phlegm. Sometimes a post-nasal drip is felt which is caused by inflamed tissue in the nose
                producing excess mucus, which then drips down into the throat. This post-nasal drip triggers the
                cough reflex. The most common causes are colds, flu, hay fever or allergic rhinitis. If a post
                nasal drip is the cause of the tickly cough, then over the counter decongestants and
                antihistamines can help alleviate symptoms.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3><span>Dry</span> cough :</h3>
            <p>A dry cough, another non-productive cough, occurs due to irritants in the air passages and causes can
                include colds, flu, hay fever, asthma, acid reflux, bronchitis and certain medications used for treating
                high blood pressure.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3><span>Nervous</span> cough :</h3>
            <p>This is also a non-productive cough, but it is not caused by physical irritants or the need to expel
                anything. A nervous cough is aggravated by feeling anxious or stressed and tends to disappear when the
                person sleeps. Other causes of cough need to be excluded before a doctor diagnoses a nervous cough. To
                manage this type of cough the root cause of anxiety or stress needs to be addressed.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3><span>Night</span> cough :</h3>
            <p>If you cough worsens or seems to appear only at night whilst you are trying to sleep then this could be
                an important symptom to identify with your doctor. Whilst it could be one of the more common causes of a
                cold or flu, where the mucus pools at night in the wrong parts of your airways when you lie down, it
                could also be symptomatic of acid reflux. When you are lying down at night the acidic contents of your
                stomach may travel back up your food pipe (esophagus) whilst you are lying flat triggering a night
                cough. Additionally, in asthma, coughing typically not only worsens during exercise, but also during the
                night.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3><span>Persistent</span> cough :</h3>
            <p>This is called a ‘chronic cough’ and is defined when a cough lasts more than eight weeks. The most common
                causes of persistent cough are allergic rhinitis, sinus infections, asthma, gastroesophageal reflux,
                eosinophilic bronchitis, smoking, infection, and medication side effects. Rarer causes include lung
                cancer, chest lymphomas, emphysema, sarcoidosis, and fungal infections including coccidiomycosis,
                histoplasmosis and tuberculosis. As you can see the possible causes of persistent cough are diverse and
                you should see a doctor if you have a cough which lasts longer than three weeks, or if you develop other
                symptoms including shortness of breath, chest pain or coughing up blood. If you have other long terms
                conditions including asthma or Chronic Obstructive Airways Disease (COPD), then you should also see your
                doctor if your symptoms are worse.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3><span>Croup </span> cough :</h3>
            <p>Croup cough specifically occurs in children under 5 and is caused by the same virus as those which cause
                the common cold, making the airways swell. First signs of croup include a stuffy nose and a fever. As
                the voice box (larynx) and windpipe (trachea) become swollen and irritated there is less room for air to
                move into the lungs and the child produces the hoarse ‘barking’ cough, sometimes compared to the sound a
                seal makes. If the airways continue to swell, then it can make it more difficult for the child to
                breathe and they develop the high-pitched squeaking noise of stridor when they breath. The symptoms
                worsen at night and when the child is upset. Most cases of croup can be treated at home and it will
                clear within a week. Allow them to breathe some moist air from a steam filled bathroom, ensure adequate
                fluids are taken, and using over the counter medication such as acetaminophen to relieve fever. If they
                develop fast rapid breathing, indrawing of breath where the skin pulls in under the ribs when breathing,
                or they have a bluish tinge round the mouth, then medical attention should be sought.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3><span>Whooping </span> cough :</h3>
            <p>Otherwise known as (pertussis), this is a serious respiratory infection which causes violent coughing
                fits. A vaccine against whooping cough is generally administered as part of the vaccination program but
                whooping cough can spread from non-immunized people to those who haven’t yet received the vaccination
                including young babies. The ‘whooping’ sound occurs when the child gasps for breath after a coughing
                fit. Babies may not cough or make the whooping sound but may gag and gasp. We’ve written about whooping
                cough specifically on this blog.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3><span>C</span>hoking :</h3>
            <p>Anyone presenting with a sudden episode of coughing or choking should seek immediate medical attention,
                in case a foreign body is present. We also have a blogpost on what to do if someone is choking.</p>
        </li>
        <h2><span>P</span>recautions :</h2>
        <p>Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze.
            Throw used tissues in the trash.
            If you don't have a tissue, cough or sneeze into your elbow, not your hands.</p>
