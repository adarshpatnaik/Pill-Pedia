            <p>A brain tumor is a growth of cells in the brain or near it. Brain tumors can happen in the brain tissue.
                Brain tumors also can happen near the brain tissue. Nearby locations include nerves, the pituitary
                gland, the pineal gland, and the membranes that cover the surface of the brain.
                Brain tumors can begin in the brain. These are called primary brain tumors. Sometimes, cancer spreads to
                the brain from other parts of the body. These tumors are secondary brain tumors, also called metastatic
                brain tumors.
                Many different types of primary brain tumors exist. Some brain tumors aren't cancerous. These are called
                noncancerous brain tumors or benign brain tumors. Noncancerous brain tumors may grow over time and press
                on the brain tissue. Other brain tumors are brain cancers, also called malignant brain tumors. Brain
                cancers may grow quickly. The cancer cells can invade and destroy the brain tissue.
                Brain tumors range in size from very small to very large. Some brain tumors are found when they are very
                small because they cause symptoms that you notice right away. Other brain tumors grow very large before
                they're found. Some parts of the brain are less active than others. If a brain tumor starts in a part of
                the brain that's less active, it might not cause symptoms right away. The brain tumor size could become
                quite large before the tumor is detected.
                Brain tumor treatment options depend on the type of brain tumor you have, as well as its size and
                location. Common treatments include surgery and radiation therapy.</p>

        <h2><span>T</span>ypes of <span>T</span>umors :</h2>
        <p>There are many types of brain tumors. The type of brain tumor is based on the kind of cells that make up the
            tumor. Special lab tests on the tumor cells can give information about the cells. Your health care team uses
            this information to figure out the type of brain tumor.

            Some types of brain tumors usually aren't cancerous. These are called noncancerous brain tumors or benign
            brain tumors. Some types of brain tumors usually are cancerous. These types are called brain cancers or
            malignant brain tumors. Some brain tumor types can be benign or malignant.

            Benign brain tumors tend to be slow-growing brain tumors. Malignant brain tumors tend to be fast-growing
            brain tumors.</p>

        <h2><span>S</span>ymptoms :</h2>
        <p>The signs and symptoms of a brain tumor depend on the brain tumor's size and location. Symptoms also might
            depend on how fast the brain tumor is growing, which is also called the tumor grade.</p>
        <br />
        <p>General signs and symptoms caused by brain tumors may include :</p>
        <li>Headache or pressure in the head that is worse in the morning</li>
        <li>Headaches that happen more often and seem more severe</li>
        <li>Headaches that are sometimes described as tension headaches or migraines</li>
        <li>Nausea or vomiting</li>
        <li>Eye problems, such as blurry vision, seeing double or losing sight on the sides of your vision</li>
        <li>Losing feeling or movement in an arm or a leg</li>
        <li>Trouble with balance</li>
        <li>Speech problems</li>
        <li>Feeling very tired</li>
        <li>Confusion in everyday matters</li>
        <li>Memory problems</li>
        <li>Having trouble following simple commands</li>
        <li>Personality or behavior changes</li>
        <li>Seizures, especially if there is no history of seizures</li>
        <li>Hearing problems</li>
        <li>Dizziness or a sense that the world is spinning, also called vertigo</li>
        <li>Feeling very hungry and gaining weight</li>
        <h2><span>C</span>auses :</h2>
        <p>Brain tumors that start as a growth of cells in the brain are called primary brain tumors. They might start
            right in the brain or in the tissue nearby. Nearby tissue might include the membranes that cover the brain,
            called meninges. Brain tumors also can happen in nerves, the pituitary gland and the pineal gland.
            Brain tumors happen when cells in or near the brain get changes in their DNA. A cell's DNA holds the
            instructions that tell the cell what to do. The changes tell the cells to grow quickly and continue living
            when healthy cells would die as part of their natural life cycle. This makes a lot of extra cells in the
            brain. The cells can form a growth called a tumor.
            It's not clear what causes the DNA changes that lead to brain tumors. For many people with brain tumors, the
            cause is never known. Sometimes parents pass DNA changes to their children. The changes can increase the
            risk of having a brain tumor. These hereditary brain tumors are rare. If you have a family history of brain
            tumors, talk about it with your health care provider. You might consider meeting with a health care provider
            trained in genetics to understand whether your family history increases your risk of having a brain tumor.
            When brain tumors happen in children, they're likely to be primary brain tumors. In adults, brain tumors are
            more likely to be cancer that started somewhere else and spread to the brain.</p>
        <h2><span>P</span>revention :</h2>
        <p>There's no way to prevent brain tumors. If you get a brain tumor, you didn't do anything to cause it.

            People with an increased risk of brain tumor might consider screening tests. Screening isn't brain tumor
            prevention. But screening might help find a brain tumor when it's small and treatment is more likely to be
            successful.

            If you have a family history of brain tumor or inherited syndromes that increase the risk of brain tumor,
            talk about it with your health care provider. You might consider meeting with a genetic counselor or other
            health care provider trained in genetics. This person can help you understand your risk and ways to manage
            it. For example, you might consider brain tumor screening tests. Testing might include an imaging test or a
            neurological exam to test your vision, hearing, balance, coordination and reflexes.</p>
